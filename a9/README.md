### Inspirations:
The main inspiration for this mask is "Egyptian Masks". Off course, Egyptian Masks are grand and bigger. However, this is my small, abstract version of an Egyptian Mask. My mother is a fan of Egyptian masks (small ones) and she has bought several masks and hung them up back at home. This mask is supposed to be a representation of all the masks combined. 

### What does your costume represent (or what vibe does it have)?
My costume is supposed to represent all the Vibrant colors. I just wanted bright colours to pop out everywhere. I believe that color brings cheer to everyone's life and I wanted to pop some colour to whoever is viewing this mask. 

### What do each of the sliders do?

#### Zoom: 

The zoom slider zooms into the mask. You can see the various detailing in the mask by using this slider

#### eyebrow:

The eyebrow slider changes the position of the eyebrow. When the slider is to the far right, the eyebrows are over the forehead.

#### FingerColour:

The FingerColour slider changes the colour of the fingers. 

### One related thought from the reading:
 One important point I related to in the video was having problems with creativity. Personally, I am always afraid of negative comments and always have the fear of being creative. Some acknowledgement from people definitely boosts my confidence and helps me open up my mind. The Professor talking about this really made me think that it was high time I stop being so worried about negative judgement and start getting creative.
