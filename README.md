# Archana's Kaleidoscope
This webpage consists of a compilation of all the work I did for Generative methods. 

My portfolio includes: 
- Three innovate GIFs developed using P5.js
- A drawing tool developed using a P5 canvas with buttons that set the mode to different drawing tools with different strokes and a button to clear the canvas. 
- Three particle swarms that react to the player's mouse cursor and each other. 
- A chatbot created using tracery and vue.js that interacted with the user and gave details about places to visit in India.
- A custom Game-of-Life cellular automata, similar to Nicky Case's Emoji Simulator app. 
- A function that takes an array of floats and returns a "catification" algorithm like the one that turns Cryptokitty tokens into Cryptokitty art.
- A function created using handsfree.js that tracks live facial expressions and hand gestures using the webcam and turns it into P5 graphics. The P5 graphics I created was a mask which moves based on the users hand and face movements.
