### Inspirations:
Looking at the samples the Professor provided us, I noticed how shapes can be deformed with the help of sliders. I wondered what if we can take an already deformed organism and play with that a little. That's why I chose to generate the Amoeba. The Amoeba is a shapeless, formless organism. I wanted to see what happens when we play with the structure of an already deformed organism. I am a very structured and organised person. Everything I do has to have form. I wanted to go out of my comfort zone and work with deformity. 

### What is your generative space? (ie, what kinds of things can this generate?)
As I already mentioned my generative space consists of shapeless Amoebas. 

### What do each of the sliders do?

#### Go Right:

The Go Right slider makes the selected Amoeba slightly tilt towards the right

#### Size:

The Size slider changes the size of the Amoeba

#### Hue:

The Hue slider plays with the colour of the amoeba.

#### hueOffset:

The Hue Offset slider also adds to the color of the amoeba

#### Spikes:

Spikes increases the number of spikes on the amoeba. It gives more shape to the shapeless amoeba. With the highest number of spikes, an amoeba kind of looks like a starfish ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰

#### threeD:

This slider is my personal favorite. It gives a 3D effect to the amoeba. When at lowest the fish moves normally but when it is increased they move in a folded manner. 

### One related thought from the reading:
I read the article: Building a better virtual world, one tree (or millions) at a time

One thought I related to while doing this assignment was that we don't see three-dimensional content on the web because nobody can create it. This class has been extremely interesting and although I haven't been creating 3D content, I can understand the hardwork and amount of code that goes into a tiny change. Similarly, one small change in the code can also change the output tremendously. No wonder not many people are creating 3D content. Especially creating something like trees would be so complicated since trees have so many shades of green, so many colors and so many features. The trees in the picture were definitely realistic and interesting to look at. Hats off to, Vladlen Koltun, the creator of the trees.  

### Citations:
Thank you, Professor, for the starter code without which it would have been impossible to finish this assignment.
