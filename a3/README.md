# Assignment 3
## Instructions to use Drawing Tool:
Open index.html in your browser (preferably Google Chrome) and enjoy Drawxie - my Drawing tool!! 

## Tool Description:
### Stars:
I basically wanted to fill the Canvas with anything that was remotely related to stars. Hence, when you click the 🤩🤩🤩 (Star) button, any emoticon that had a star in it can be displayed across the Canvas. Click the mouse and drag it on the Canvas, to fill it with anything that has stars. 

### NeonCircles:
I wanted to spread colour with this tool. On clicking the tool (🔴🟣🔵 ) and dragging the mouse across the Canvas, small neon coloured circles are displayed. The distance between the circles depend on how fast you move the mouse. The colour of the circles change as you move the mouse. 

### PencilShades:
For this tool, I wanted to focus on free hand drawing with a pencil and play around with curves at the same time. When you click this tool (✏️🕶 )and drag the mouse across the screen, a line is drawn in blue from which a red and yellow curve forms in the shape in which the pencil moved across the screen. The yellow section forms curves in the direction in which the pencil moved. 

### 🧼🧼🧼 :
Clicking this button, clears the screen.

### Colors and Tool size:
The colors used by the tools can be changed using the color palettes available at the bottom of the Canvas. The slider can be used to increase the size of the brushes. 

## Musings on Reading -> Casual Creators: Designing tools for casual creativity
I was particularly able to relate to the zine on Casual creators. One main reason would be because after reading this zine I realised I could probably be called a casual creator. Just as the article mentions, I often find something big, strange and surprising emerging from my simple gesture's and I definitely took pride in what I made till date (I sent all the GIFs I made to all my friends and family 😉)

I was also able to relate to the point "For every portrait in the gallery, there are over 100 doodles pinned to the refrigerator". I could also relate to one specific property about casual creators. Casually creative people don't have a grand plan of what they want to  make. They want to have a good experience while making something, explore their creativity and only then care about the final product. This was my attitude when I enrolled for this class. I wanted to enjoy the process and learn something interesting instead of focusing on the final product alone.

While creating the drawing tool I kept the Gulf of Execution in mind - the distance between the user's intention and their ability to enact them. I am hoping users find it easy to use all the tools in my Drawing Tool.
