### Let's Tour India!
Let's Tour India is a Chatbot that is a tour guide to places in India. The Chatbot has India divided into 4 regions - North, South, East and West. On clicking the region, we get to know about an interesting place in that region of India. Each input type and output type is explained below:

#### Input Types:
üöµ - The Hola Button prints an introductory message on the screen. On clicking this button, the chatbot prints a message and also speaks the message out. 

‚¨ÜÔ∏è - The North-India button  displays  an image  of a mountain range in North India and some text about the image that was displayed. 

‚¨áÔ∏è - The South-India button displays an image of a temple in South India and some text about the image that was displayed. 

‚û°Ô∏è - The East-India button displays an image of a famous bridge in East India and some text about the image that was displayed.

‚¨ÖÔ∏è - The West-India button displays an image of the Thar desert and some text about the image that was displayed. 

üí∞ - The Save-money button is a fun button. On clicking the button, you save up money for your India trip and once you have enough money the chatBot displays a message. (You need to save money only once for the trip). 

üëã - The Bye button displays a GIF on the screen. 

The user can also type the necessary key words in the text box to get details about a region of India. 

#### Output Types:
The introductory message is displayed on the screen in TEXT FORMAT and the bot also reads it out using SPEECH SYNTHESIS.

When the other buttons are clicked a message is displayed in TEXT FORMAT and an IMAGE is displayed on the screen.

When the Bye button is clicked a GIF is displayed on the screen. 

When the user types something that the bot does not understand, the bot displays a TEXT message and also reads out the message using SPEECH SYNTHESIS. 

The output types I have used here are TEXT, IMAGES, GIF and VOICE.
