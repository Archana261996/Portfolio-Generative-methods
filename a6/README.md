### Inspirations:
I drew my inspiration for this simulation from the parable of the talents in the bible. This used to be one of my favourite parables back in school. The parable of talents talks about a master who gives talents to his servants before he leaves town. The servant to whom he gives 5 talents invests the 5 talents and has a total of 10 talents. The servant who was given 3 talents doubles that and has a total of 6 talents. The servant who was given 1 talent was scared of losing the talent, hence he buried it in the ground and did not in any way invest the talents. The master got furious that the last servant did not take risks and invest his talent so he took that away and gave it to the servant with 10 talents

### What layers are in your simulation, and what does each layer contain?
I made use of 🧱 (bricks) and 🤩  (I call this emoji talents) emoji in my first layer. The second layer, some of my bricks are replaced with 🤑  emoji and finally I have 🍻(denotes celebration) in my third layer (this comes up only in the first simulation). The third simulation makes use of ⚠️ and 🎭  emojis  instead of the 🤑 and celebration emoji.

### What are the update rules for each cell?
The 🤩  emoji are multiplied and are placed wherever there are obstacles (🧱) (the cell next to the obstacles). The obstacles (some of them) are replaced with 🤑 emoji which are then replaced with 🍻 (celebration) emoji. 

The second simulation has similar rules. The talent emojis are multiplied and 🤑 replaces the obstacles. However, we have no celebration in this simulation. 

Since the talents don't multiply in this simulation, some of the obstacles are replaced with Danger (⚠️) and Sad  (🎭) emojis which are displayed in an "alarming" fashion. 

### What argument are you trying to make?
I am trying to illustrate the parable of talents through this simulation. The parable is mentioned in the first paragraph. My simulation is explained below: 

The first mode is called 5 talents. In this intepretation the 🤩 represents talents(or as I would like to call it joy). Since we are spreading joy, it goes everywhere and we rejoice with celebration (🍻) and money (🤑). This is an extremely cheerful simulation with money and celebration. Notice that the 🤩 fills the spaces which are empty with no neighbouring bricks, a few bricks are replaced with 🤑 and a few of the 🤑 are replaced with 🍻. If there were bricks in the cells and the neighbouring cells were empty nothing happens in those cells.

The second mode has fewer 🤩 smileys indicating the fact that the second servant got fewer talents (or in my case Joy). Note that the joy still spreads through the cells which still brings about monetory benefits to everyone. However, since there is lesser cheer to spread we do not have celebration 🍻 in this simulation. The Joy 🤩 spreads to the empty cells and most of the bricks are replaced with 🤑 in this simulation.

The third mode is a representation of the master giving the last servant 1 talent. We have very few 🤩 in this simulation. They do not spread across the cells because in this story the servant does not use his talent, he buries it and keeps it safe. Burying the talent ultimately made the servant sad because the master took the talent away from him. Similarly, not spreading joy to everyone will ultimately make us sad. This is represented by the danger symbol ⚠️ and sad symbol 🎭 in this simulation. Danger icons are placed in a few empty cells and are alternatively displayed along with the sad symbol in this simulation. This is supposed to denote the sadness and danger that comes with not spreading joy. 

### Does the simulation currently support your argument?
I tried my best to get my simulation to support my argument. It does explain the parable as my own intepretation just as I wanted it. I wish I could have gotten the last simulation to be an infinite loop between the sad and danger emojis instead of them blinking in an alarming fashion. 
  
### One related thought from the reading:
I liked reading the parable of the polygons. I really liked the entire theme of the article. It was structured in the form of an interesting game but taught us several life lessons. Some lessons really stood out to  me. In this article, the author mentions that creating equality takes work and that its always a work in progress. The article also talks about going out of our comfort zones (going beyond just our neighbours). This article helps everyone understand how much we can learn from stepping out of our comfort zone. This point really stood out to me in this article.
